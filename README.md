# selfTestProject2
We are going to build our own Test with blackjack and ladies!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the project for the students who take PK1 course during winter semester 2014-2015 in Konstanz Uni.

Here we want to create all test methods which prove that our code is right or, at least, show us where we have bugs BEFORE we submit our work. 

It's legal to do so till we not share our private solutions to the project.

Test methods should be universal and work for everyone. Imagine if your were a Tutor and your task was to find as many mistakes in our code as you can (I'm convinced they really have instructions like this).

I HOPE Tutors will also check this Test out and will give us some feedback - did we understand the assignment right? is there any other things we need to pay attention to?   

I also think it's going to be a very good exercise for us.

Let's not verkacken this project.

Let's build a perfect Test together.
